/**
 * Contains the service classes for the Movie Managment console application.
 *
 * This package includes classes that provide business logic and data manipulation functionalities
 * that operate between the model layer and the controller. The services handle more complex operations
 * and interactions involving data processing, such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving movie data,
 * as well as calculating statistics. Examples of classes in this package include MoviesService, which manages
 * movie data operations, and StatisticsService, which provides functionality to compute various statistics
 * related to the movies.
 *
 * The service layer abstracts the logic required to access and manipulate the model data, thereby separating
 * the concerns of data management from the model and controller layers, which are responsible for representing
 * data and handling user interaction, respectively.
