/**
 * Contains the view classes for the Movie Management application.
 *
 * This package provides classes responsible for all user interactions and displays in the application.
 * The views handle the presentation of data to the user and gather user inputs. Examples of classes in this
 * package include MainView, which facilitates the main user interactions, and ErrorView, which is dedicated
 * to displaying error messages. Additionally, StatisticsView presents various statistical data of the movie data.
 *
 * The view layer is designed to be separate from the business logic and data access layers, which allows
 * for easier modifications and maintenance of the user interface without impacting the underlying application logic.
